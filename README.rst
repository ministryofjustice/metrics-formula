apparmor
========

This formula includes some simple default apparmor profiles.

App armor is by default in complain mode which means it allows the action and
logs. To make it deny actions that the profile doesn't cover set the following
pillar::

  apparmor:
    profiles:
      collectd:
        enforce: ''
      carbon_cache:
        enforce: ''
